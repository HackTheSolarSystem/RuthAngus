				<p> What you are probing is the acoustic oscillations in stars, which is their speed of sound. The
					acoustic oscillations can tell us about the density and size of an object. As stars get older, they
					get less dense and bigger. The oscillations in the older stars are deeper (lower frequency). Take
					for example a cello. It has a low sound because its oscillation cavity is bigger and it is more
					hollow. The stellar oscillation frequencies can therefore tell us the age of stars. Older stars are
					less active, so planet signals are easier to detect. Selecting the oldest star would allow for the
					best potential research. As a result, you must select the oldest star, which is the star with the
					deepest oscillations in order to win.</p>
