### Installation Instructions (Local Development)

We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a templating engine.

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). Ruby comes pre-installed on macOS and some linux distros, but needs to be installed on platforms where it does not come pre-installed.
2. Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/): `gem install bundler`.
3. Run `bundle install`.
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
