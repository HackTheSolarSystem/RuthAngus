		<p> Dr. Ruth Angus is an Assistant Curator of Astrophysics at the AMNH. She also works as an associate research scientist at the Flatiron Institute and an adjunct professor of astronomy at Columbia University.
		Her research interests include: stellar rotation, magnetism and evolution; exoplanet populations, formation and evolution; galactic archaeology; astronomical surveys; and statistical data analysis and machine learning methods.
		Dr. Angusâ€™ interest in extrasolar planets comes from her desire to reveal the processes behind the formation of these worlds and how they are distributed across the galaxy. 
		Dr. Angus studies the stars found within our Milky Way, with the help of Kepler, Tess, and Gaia, developing new methods to measure the age of stars and the planets that orbit them. Likewise, Dr. Angus is exploring the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. To do so, she has been studying the stellar rotation and magnetic activity, as well as the affects of stellar magnetism, on planets. Her research implements statistical data analysis and machine learning methods throughout her research.
