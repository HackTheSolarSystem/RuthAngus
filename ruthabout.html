				<br><span style="padding-left:2em">Her research interests include: stellar rotation, magnetism and
					evolution; exoplanet populations, formation and evolution; galactic archaeology; astronomical
					surveys; and statistical data analysis and machine learning
					Dr. Angusâ€™ interest in extrasolar planets comes from her desire to reveal the processes behind the
